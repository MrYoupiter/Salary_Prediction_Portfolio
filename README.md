# Salary Prediction Project - *(Predictive Analytics in Python)*

## Aim

Predicting the salary for a job position is crucial for a business' HR & talent function for optimizing compensation strategy and talent retention in a highly competetive labour market. The aim of this project is to build a salary prediction model for existing and future job seekers by examining an existing dataset of job postings.

The analysis is aimed at explaining every step of the process from defining the problem, discovering dataset, developing model and deploying into production. The model applies data transformation and machine learning on features such as work experience, Job Type, Majors, Industry Type, Degree and Miles from metropolis. The final aim is to predict salary for a job posting based on these available features.

## Dataset Information

The data provided to us has been split in training and testing sets. The files included are training data (train_features_df), testing data (test_features_df) and a Target set (train_salaries_df) containing dependent salary feature.
